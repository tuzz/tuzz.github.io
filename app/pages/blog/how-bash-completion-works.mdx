Bash completion for <a href="https://github.com/tuzz/zz">‘The tuzz automation tool’</a>
</Figure.Video>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={282}>
I think ‘completion’ and ‘auto-completion’ mean the same in this context. I’ll
use the former for brevity.
</Aside>

Over the years I’ve developed a command-line tool I use for routine tasks such
as provisioning my machine, generating project templates and managing secrets.
The tool is written in Ruby and I invoke it with the `zz` command.

Most of <span ref={r = createRef()}>what</span> it does is fairly
straightforward. The clever bits are usually delegated to something else. For
example, `zz provision` is really just a wrapper that installs and runs Chef,
while passing various options to it.

<Aside target={r}>

It uses [chef-solo](https://docs.chef.io/chef_solo.html) which is a slimmed down
version of Chef that runs on a single node. No server needed.

</Aside>

Recently, I added Bash completion to my tool. I’ve wanted this for a while, but
decided to add it now in preparation for <span ref={r = createRef()}>secrets
management.</span> For example, I want to be able to type `zz secret --read
amaz<TAB><TAB> ` and have it complete to `zz secret --read amazon/`.  Perhaps
hitting `<TAB>` again will list all secrets under this path, e.g. username,
password, access_key, etc.

<Aside target={r}>

I haven’t actually implemented secrets management yet. Currently, I’m running
`gpg --encrypt` and `--decrypt` a lot so hopefully I’ll find time to add this
feature soon.

</Aside>

## The mechanics

In <span ref={r = createRef()}>Bash</span>, completion is handled through the `complete` ‘built-in’:

```bash
$ type complete
complete is a shell builtin
```

<Aside target={r}>

[Builtins](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Builtins.html)
are commands ‘built into’ the shell. They provide basic operations like `echo`,
`help` and `type`:

```bash
$ type type
type is a shell builtin
```

</Aside>

This command allows you to register a method of completion for a command. For
example, an `rgb` command might register its known colors:

<Figure>

```bash
$ complete -W "red green blue yellow purple pink orange" color
```

Setting a hardcoded list of completions
</Figure>

You could then complete color names:

```bash
$ color <TAB><TAB>
blue    green   orange  pink    purple  red     yellow

$ color p<TAB><TAB>
pink    purple

$ color pi<TAB> # completes to pink
```

The `-W` switch configures a static list of completions that are printed in
alphabetical order. It’s just one of the many methods of <span ref={r = createRef()}>completion.</span>

<Aside target={r}><p>
It’s also the simplest.
</p></Aside>

### Listing completion methods

To see which commands have completion methods, run `complete` without arguments:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure>

```bash
$ complete
complete -W 'red green blue yellow purple pink orange' color
complete -F _nodenv nodenv
complete -F _rbenv rbenv
```

Listing all registered completion methods
</Figure>


<Aside target={r} moveDown={12}><p>
If you try to complete commands without registered methods, Bash uses its
default behaviour and lists files in the current directory.
</p></Aside>

Here you can see `nodenv` and `rbenv` support completion. They use the `-F`
switch to specify functions to handle their completion, <span ref={r =
createRef()}>namely</span> `_nodenv` and `_rbenv`. When you complete one of
these commands, their output is context-aware:

```bash
$ rbenv install 2.5<TAB><TAB>
2.5.0          2.5.0-rc1      2.5.1          2.5.2          2.5.3
```
<Aside target={r}>

It seems to be a convention to name these Bash functions `_<command>`.

</Aside>

That’s helpful! `rbenv` has kindly listed which Ruby **2.5.x** versions are available
to install. We could find this out from `rbenv install --list` but that’s
inefficient because we’d have to clear our current command then re-type it.

## How completion _functions_ work

When a function is registered as the method of completion with the `-F` switch,
it must comply with an ‘interface’ of sorts. When the function is called, Bash
sets some environment variables to be used by the completion function.

They <span ref={r = createRef()}>tell</span> it the contents of the
command-line, the cursor position, etc. For example, `$COMP_LINE` contains the
full line that was typed, `$COMP_WORDS` is that same line broken into an array
of words and `$COMP_POINT` is the cursor’s index position.

In return, the completion function should set `$COMPREPLY` to specify which
completions to print for the command.

<Aside target={r}>

Using environment variables as a means of passing information back and forth
seems kind of awkward. Bash _is_ pretty old, though.

</Aside>

### An example

Everybody loves FizzBuzz, right? Let’s demonstrate Bash completion with a custom
function that *magically* completes the next term in the sequence:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure>

```bash
function _fizzbuzz () {
  length=${#COMP_WORDS[@]}
  number=$((length - 1))

  if   ! ((number % 15)); then COMPREPLY=(fizzbuzz)
  elif ! ((number % 3));  then COMPREPLY=(fizz)
  elif ! ((number % 5));  then COMPREPLY=(buzz)
  else                         COMPREPLY=($number)
  fi
}

complete -F _fizzbuzz fizzbuzz
```

Setting a Bash function to complete `fizzbuzz`
</Figure>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={25}>

In Bash, you can access elements in an array, or get its length like this:

```bash
first=${SOME_ARRAY[0]}
second=${SOME_ARRAY[1]}

length=${#SOME_ARRAY[@]}
```

</Aside>

Our <span ref={r = createRef()}>command</span> is called `fizzbuzz` so we name
our completion function `_fizzbuzz`, as per the convention. We first set the
`length` variable to the number of words on the command-line and `number` to
one less, since ‘`fizzbuzz`’ itself counts as a word.

We’ve probably all seen FizzBuzz before so let’s skip the modulo logic. The
important part is to set `$COMPREPLY` - in this case, to an array of the next
term in the sequence.


Now, if we type `fizzbuzz <TAB><TAB>`, Bash completion kicks in and as if by
*magic* the next term is appended to the current command-line.  Our `fizzbuzz`
command doesn’t actually exist but that doesn’t seem to matter!

<Aside target={r}>

I do wonder if this could be used as an attack vector:

```bash
function _ls () {
  # do something nasty
}

complete -F _ls ls
```

Of course, we’d need permissions to register completion functions which we won’t
have so it’s probably fine?

</Aside>

<span ref={r = createRef()} />
<span ref={r2 = createRef()} />

<Figure.Video src="/videos/fizzbuzz-completion.mp4" className="more_space">
Using Bash completion to generate the FizzBuzz sequence
</Figure.Video>


<Aside target={r} moveDown={90}>

If the completion function returns a single option, Bash immediately completes
it without prompting us.

That means we can hold down `<TAB>` to continuously complete the FizzBuzz
sequence. Hooray!

</Aside>


<Aside target={r2} moveDown={320}>

Surely this is the best way to implement FizzBuzz in a coding interview? Or
maybe [this](https://github.com/tuzz/fizzquinebuzz)?

</Aside>


As you can see, there’s plenty of fun to be had! In
[part two](/blog/adding-bash-completion) we’ll implement Bash completion for my
automation tool and see how it works in practice.
