</Narration>

No, I‚Äôm not 100 years old. This blog <span ref={r = createRef()}>marks</span>
[my 100th personal repository](https://github.com/tuzz/tuzz.tech) on GitHub. An
arbitrary milestone that bears no real significance other than as testament to
my endless tinkering, insatiable curiosity and belief that making things is
perhaps the best way to really understand something.

<Aside target={r}><p>
Technically, only 93 are public. Legend has it, the remaining seven contain
code so horrifying those who glance at it turn to stone.
</p></Aside>

**In all that time, why haven‚Äôt I blogged about it?**

Those sleepless nights my brain won‚Äôt switch off, exploring the twisting
avenues on some project. The occasions I‚Äôm frantically scribbling away, working
through the minutiae of an esoteric problem. Or the intense lucidity and
feelings of purpose that arise from programming for hours at
a <span ref={r = createRef()}>time</span>.

<Aside target={r}><p>
It‚Äôs either that or the coffee.
</p></Aside>

It saddens me how much of this is lost to my own fleshy forgetfulness. A
failure to document and share outwardly what‚Äôs going on between my ears.
Sure, I‚Äôve written some
[extraordinarily long READMEs](https://github.com/tuzz/supersat), but I‚Äôm
kidding myself if anyone will discover and engage with material of that
formality.

Well <span ref={r = createRef()}>change</span> is happening. Our climate is
dying and no longer will I allow apathy to deter me from writing. I will not
convince myself I cannot write or that it‚Äôs unimportant to me.  The resistance
is strong but I will work through the drudgery to improve my writing ability so
I can share what I‚Äôm doing.

<Aside target={r}>

At time of writing, it‚Äôs the global climate strike.

‚ÄúThe resistance‚Äù is a reference to
[The War of Art](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art).

</Aside>

**Why? Because the opportunity costs are too high.**

There are so many brilliant, clever and inspiring people in this world and here
I am, working mostly in isolation on things I genuinely think would be
captivating and interesting to a number of people. In return, I‚Äôd be grateful
for their wisdom, insight <span ref={r = createRef()}>and </span>opportunities
to collaborate in crafting something broader in scope than I can alone.

<Aside target={r}><p>
Or just their attention, really. To feed my narcissism.
</p></Aside>

More than that, I believe in the Internet‚Äôs ability to bring people together
with similar interests. Forging communities that transcend geography and time.
Communities that simply couldn‚Äôt exist otherwise. I want to play a part in
that. I think I‚Äôd benefit from crawling out from under my rock once in a while.

**So here I am, <span ref={r = createRef()}>muddy</span> and regretful yet
optimistic about the future.**

<Aside target={r}><p>
I‚Äôm not actually muddy.
</p></Aside>

I have a multitude of stories to tell, old and new about things I‚Äôve built and
the many curiosities electrifying my brain. Most projects serve no purpose
other than as acts of creativity or to build a deeper understanding of some
topic. Usually circling the theme of computer science. Here are some examples:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

- [a neural network](https://tuzz.github.io/twelve_days/bin/) to classify words
from the ‚ÄòTwelve days of Christmas‚Äô
- [a 3D game engine](https://tuzz.github.io/game-engine/) (written in Rust) that
runs in your browser
- [a puzzle-solving programming language](https://sentient-lang.org) I spent the
best part of a year building

<Aside target={r}><p>
I spent a while deciding what to put here. These are biased towards projects
with visuals but I work on plenty of interesting things where the only output
is a terminal.
</p></Aside>

This is really just the tip of the iceberg. There‚Äôs plenty of substance beyond
the shiny demos and visual delights. <span ref={r = createRef()}>What‚Äôs more</span>,
I have a keen interest in the act of programming itself. Writing aesthetically
pleasing code. Playing with various paradigms and architectures. Not that I
claim to know what on earth I‚Äôm doing.

<Aside target={r}>

My game engine, for example, uses an ECS pattern which I learned about in
[this excellent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKLntZcp27M) by Katherine
West.

</Aside>

A world of uncertainty awaits. I have innumerable questions and nonsensical
ideas to pursue. There are hard puzzles and enigmatic problems lurking out of
sight, conspiring to shut me down and chuckle at my foolish endeavour. I cannot
wait to meet you.
