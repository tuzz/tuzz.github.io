<div className="note">
This is the second of two parts. Part one
is <a href="/blog/react-commentary-sidebar">here</a>.
</div>

In part one, we created a sidebar that lets us comment on articles. We built a
React component that auto-aligns itself with specific words or phrases. The
`<Aside>` component binds a listener in case the window is resized:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure>

```javascript
const Aside = ({ target, children, moveDown }) => {
  const [style, setStyle] = useState(null);

  const align = () => {
    const rectangle = target.current.getBoundingClientRect();
    const offset = window.scrollY + rectangle.top + moveDown;

    setStyle({ top: offset });
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    align(); // Align when the component is mounted.

    const listener = window.addEventListener("resize", align);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", listener);
  }, []);

  return (
    <aside className={css.aside} style={style}>
      {children}
    </aside>
  );
};

export default Aside;
```

Continuing from where we left off
</Figure>


<Aside target={r} moveDown={80}>

This includes the `moveDown` property which moves the comment down by an
additional fixed amount.

</Aside>


In <span ref={r = createRef()}>this</span> part, we’ll extend the component
with additional functionality to make it more robust and better-able to cope
with slow-loading content, print layouts, etc.

<Aside target={r}><p>
We’ll also add some polish with a sweet CSS fade in animation.
</p></Aside>

## Slow-loading content

Currently the component positions itself when mounted, but what happens if
images and fonts take a few seconds to load asynchronously? They might affect
the layout by pushing content down, throwing our comments out of alignment.
Something like this:

<Frame src="/examples/sidebar-3/example.html" autoScale={false} />

What we really want is for comments to re-align themselves after images and
other slow-loading content has loaded. How can we get this to work?

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure>
<Frame src="/examples/sidebar-3/example.html?align" autoScale={false} />

Re-aligning comments after images have loaded
</Figure>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={75}>

Actually, if you refresh this page you’ll see these frames are examples of
slow-loading content.

</Aside>

We could try and listen in to these events but that would mean polluting our app
with event listeners for all manner of things: we’d have to register `onLoad`
events for images and try to use the
[Font Loading API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Font_Loading_API) to
detect when fonts have loaded.

The simplest approach I’ve found is to just use timeouts re-align comments at
set times in anticipation of slow-loading content. This is a _hack_ and isn’t
perfectly reliable, but I’ve found it works well enough in practice and it’s
easy to implement:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure>

```javascript
const Aside = ({ target, children, moveDown = 0 }) => {
  // ...

  useEffect(() => {
    const delays = [200, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 15000, 30000];
    const timeouts = delays.map(d => window.setTimeout(callback, d));

    return () => timeouts.forEach(t => window.clearTimeout(t));
  }, []);

  // ...
};
```

Using timeouts to re-align `<Aside>` elements
</Figure>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={90}>
I re-align often early on as the page loads, then slow it down.
</Aside>

There are cases where this approach won’t work. For example, if the user can
expand something on the page, the layout might change. We <span ref={r =
createRef()}>could</span> additionally use `setInterval` and periodically
re-align elements every few seconds as well.

<Aside target={r}>

I don’t really like using `setInterval` if I can avoid it as it bloats the page.

</Aside>

### Hooks

To avoid cluttering our component, we can extract functionality into
[React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html):

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure>

```javascript
const useDelays = (callback, delays, dependencies = []) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const timeouts = delays.map(d => window.setTimeout(callback, d));

    return () => timeouts.forEach(t => window.clearTimeout(t));
  }, dependencies);
};

export default useDelays;
```

Extracting a hook to register the timeouts
</Figure>

<Aside target={r}>

This hook optionally takes `dependencies` to make it more reusable, but we
don’t strictly need it for our `<Aside>` component.

</Aside>

While we’re at it, let’s do the same for our resize listener:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure>

```javascript
const useResize = (callback, dependencies = []) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const listener = window.addEventListener("resize", callback);

    return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", listener)
  }, dependencies);
};

export default useResize;
```

Extracting a hook to listen to the resize event
</Figure>

<Aside target={r}>

Again, this takes `dependencies`.

</Aside>

This neatens up our component considerably:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure>

```javascript
const Aside = ({ target, children, moveDown = 0 }) => {
  // ...

  useEffect(align, []); // Align when the component is mounted.
  useResize(align);
  useDelays(align, [200, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 15000, 30000]);

  // ...
};
```

A much tidier component that uses hooks
</Figure>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={73}><p>
My first pass at this component was a mess with ~100 lines of code. Hooks tidy
things up a lot.
</p></Aside>

We’ll use this approach of extracting hooks to keep our component clean as we
add sophistication. It also means these behaviours are modular and can be
reused later.

## A race condition

Occasionally, when resizing the window, React would throw the following error:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure.Image src="/images/get-bounding-rect-error.png" alt="getBoundingClientRect error">
An error that sometimes happens on resize
</Figure.Image>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={115}>
As I write this article, I keep seeing this image and think I’ve broken the
code. It’s very off-putting.
</Aside>

I think this happens because of a race condition between the resize event and
React’s event loop. Sometimes `target` refers to an `undefined` element.

This <span ref={r = createRef()}>shouldn’t</span> be the case because the
referenced element always exists and is before the `<Aside>` in the DOM, but
React might be in the middle of re-rendering the component and hasn’t updated
its `ref` yet. It throws an error when we try to use it.

<Aside target={r}><p>
I’m not sure this is actually the problem but it’s my best guess. I’m by no
means a React expert.
</p></Aside>

We can fix this problem with a guard condition in the `align` function:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure>

```javascript
const align = () => {
  const current = target.current;
  if (!current) return; // Guard a race condition.

  const rectangle = current.getBoundingClientRect();
  const offset = window.scrollY + rectangle.top + moveDown;

  setStyle({ top: offset });
};
```

Fixing the problem by adding a guard clause
</Figure>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={15}>

We could probably extract this into some kind of hook, too. I don’t want to go
too _hook-crazy_, though.

</Aside>

### Debouncing

The <span ref={r = createRef()}>above</span> error draws attention to the fact
that the browser fires hundreds of events when the window is resized. This
exasperates the problem because React competes with the resize handler for
execution time, making the race condition more likely.

<Aside target={r}><p>
An event is fired every time the dimensions of the window change, even by a
small amount.
</p></Aside>

We’ve fixed the problem by guarding against it, but it’s probably sensible to
also reduce the number of re-alignments per second. There’s no need to re-align
hundreds of times in a row as the user drags the edges of their browser to
resize it.

In the same spirit as before, we’ll use a hook for this:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure>

```javascript
const alignSoon = useDebounce(align, 50);

useResize(alignSoon);
useDelays(alignSoon, [200, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 15000, 30000]);
```

Wrapping the `align` function with a `useDebounce` hook
</Figure>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={35}><p>
We may as well debounce the timeouts as well in case the user is resizing at the
same time.
</p></Aside>

Now <span ref={r = createRef()}>when</span> the user resizes their browser,
there will be a delay of 50 milliseconds before comments are re-aligned, vastly
reducing the overhead of resizing.

<Aside target={r}>

It’s not JavaScript that’s expensive, it’s changes to the DOM and styles that
cause the page to re-render.

That’s partly why React is so popular because it defers updates until necessary
by using a [virtual DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html).

</Aside>

This is noticeable, too. Before, when resizing the browser, the page was glitchy
and slow to update. It’s much smoother with debouncing. I didn’t write the
debouncing implementation, I used
[this one](https://gist.github.com/mudge/eb9178a4b6d595ffde8f9cb31744afcf) from
[Tom Stuart](https://twitter.com/tomstuart) and
[Paul Mucur](https://twitter.com/mudge).

## Printing

Honestly, <span ref={r = createRef()}>printing</span> web pages is a mess.
You’d expect to get more-or-less the same version of the page you can see when
you hit print, but that’s not how it works. Instead, it’s [steeped in
history](https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/the-neglected-and-meandering-history-of-printing-websites-cf304824f9b1)
and works in arbitrary and unexpected ways.

<Aside target={r}>

In Chrome and Firefox there is a way to print exactly what you see on screen but
[it’s hidden](https://superuser.com/questions/846082/how-to-get-wysiwyp-print-what-you-see-in-a-web-browser) in dev tools.

</Aside>

For example, some browsers fire [`onbeforeprint` and
`onafterprint`](https://caniuse.com/#feat=beforeafterprint) events. There’s also
[MediaQueryList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaQueryList)
but <span ref={r = createRef()}>only</span>
[some browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaQueryList#Browser_compatibility)
support event listeners. Other browsers scale content down by default and
remove backgrounds and images.

<Aside target={r}><p>
This is good because it saves ink, I just wish it was standardised.
</p></Aside>

### Why do I care?

I don’t actually think anyone will print these pages. The reason I care is
because printing has subsumed a feature people do actually use: exporting web
pages to PDF.

I’d <span ref={r = createRef()}>like</span> to be able to offer downloadable
versions of articles for offline reading or perhaps even produce a short ebook
someday. It’d be nice to use all the features I’ve developed for this blog
without having to familiarise myself with a new tool.

<Aside target={r} moveDown={-6}>

[electron-pdf](https://github.com/fraserxu/electron-pdf) looks to be a good
choice to automate the creation of PDFs from web pages. Alternatively,
[Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) has support for this.

</Aside>

### The problem

When I first tried to print, I found the alignment of comments in the sidebar
was slightly off. Everything was a bit lower than it should be and this was
exaggerated further down with comments toward the end of the article. What’s
going on?

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure.Image src="/images/wrong-print-alignment.png" alt="Wrong print alignment" className="more_space border">
Incorrect alignment in Chrome’s print dialogue
</Figure.Image>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={110}>

The red arrows point to the targets of the `<Aside>` elements. The comments are
all slightly misaligned.

At first I thought they were off by a fixed amount but it varies depending on
which page you’re on.

</Aside>

I <span ref={r = createRef()}>think</span> what’s happening is a fresh version
of the page is rendered when the print dialogue is opened. It changes the
layout of the page by scaling its content and setting margins but doesn’t
trigger a resize event to re-align the comments.

<Aside target={r}>

I also found [this bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=697233)
from 2017 which might be related. It doesn’t look like it’ll be fixed any time
soon.

</Aside>

You can control some things through print stylesheets and `@media print` style
rules but it’s harder to reliably detect in JavaScript when the page is being
printed.

### The solution

Eventually, I wrote another hook that works _most_ of the time:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />
<span ref={r2 = createRef()} />
<span ref={r3 = createRef()} />

<Figure>

```javascript
const usePrint = (onChange) => {
  const [isPrinting, setPrinting] = useState(false);

  const handleChange = (printing) => {
    if (printing === isPrinting) return;

    setPrinting(printing);
    onChange(printing);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const beforeListener = window.addEventListener("beforeprint", () => handleChange(true));
    const afterListener = window.addEventListener("afterprint", () => handleChange(false));

    const printMedia = window.matchMedia("print");
    const printListener = printMedia.addListener((e) => handleChange(e.matches));

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("beforeprint", beforeListener);
      window.removeEventListener("afterprint", afterListener);

      printMedia.removeListener(printListener);
    };
  });

  return isPrinting;
};

export default usePrint;
```

A React hook to detect print events
</Figure>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={50}>

`handleChange` only calls `onChange` if the state has actually changed. Some
browsers fire multiple print events at once.

</Aside>

<Aside target={r2} moveDown={270}>

Notice the slight interface difference?

`addListener` vs. `addEventListener`

I didn’t.

</Aside>

<Aside target={r3} moveDown={500}>

I made it so the hook returns `isPrinting`, but I don’t actually use it in the
component.

</Aside>


I then use this hook in the `<Aside>` component to trigger a re-alignment. It’s
important not to debounce these calls. If we do, the print dialogue blocks the
page while it renders a print version and we’ve missed our slot.

Here’s how use the hook:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure>

```javascript
const Aside = ({ target, children, moveDown = 0 }) => {
  // ...

  useEffect(align, []);
  usePrint(align);  // Immediately call the function.

  // ...
};
```

Re-aligning `<Aside>` elements on print
</Figure>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={72}>
It took me a while to figure out not to debounce these calls.
</Aside>

This hook isn’t perfect but it seems to work well in Chrome and Safari. I still
need to do more work to add a print stylesheet to make it look nice but at
least it’s no longer broken... except in Firefox which likes to overlap all the
comments:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure.Image src="/images/firefox-broken-comments.png" alt="Broken comments while printing in Firefox">
Printing comments in Firefox is still broken
</Figure.Image>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={85}>

This is how Firefox prints the comments for _this_ article.

</Aside>

I’ll try to fix it someday but for now I’m happy it works in WebKit. That means
I can produce prepared PDFs, rather than encourage _anyone_ to use the print
dialogue.

## Final touches

It can look messy if `<Aside>` elements jump around a lot as the page loads.
This will happen a bit as slow-loading content is added to the page but we can
smooth things over a little by fading in our comments after the first alignment
has happened:

```javascript
const align() {
  //...

  setStyle({ top: offset, opacity: 1, transition: "opacity 0.3s" });
}
```

Also, if you’re using `<Aside>` elements a lot, be mindful that each time you
do, even listeners are being registered on `window`. This can add up over time:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure.Image src="/images/many-resize-listeners.png" alt="Many resize listeners" className="border">
Event listeners registered for the window
</Figure.Image>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={100}><p>
You can see registered listeners in Chrome by inspecting any element, opening
the ‘Event Listeners’ tab then selecting the ‘Ancestors’ option.
</p></Aside>

It <span ref={r = createRef()}>would</span> be better to register a single
handler for each type of event and re-align all comments through that. I
haven’t implemented this but will probably add this later.

<Aside target={r}>

[This](https://hackernoon.com/do-you-still-register-window-event-listeners-in-each-component-react-in-example-31a4b1f6f1c8)
looks to be a good resource on how to do this using [PubSub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern).

Alternatively, you could use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

</Aside>

### Final thoughts

In this article, we’ve taken a detailed look at how to build a commentary
sidebar in React. This has a few rough edges but overall I’m really happy with
how it turned out.

It’s already become an integral part of how I think about writing. A tool I can
reach for when I want to say _a little bit more_ about something, without being
too distracting.

I’m really enjoying the process of writing and learning React so it’s been fun
to combine the two. For reference, here’s the most up to date version of the
code:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />
<span ref={r2 = createRef()} />
<span ref={r3 = createRef()} />
