A few weeks ago I spent a pleasant evening pair programming with my friend
[Dmitry](https://twitter.com/dmitrykandalov) for [his YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsTlWmqtrIc3PrClVbb_9ZA). We worked
on a couple of problems in [Sentient](https://sentient-lang.org/), which is a
language I wrote a few years ago. The first of these videos is here:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

A gentle (but hands on) introduction to the language

Towards the end (around 23:00), I bravely try to run our code in a browser but
it fails. :-(

It turns out, the Sentient website is actually running a slightly out of date
version of the compiler. Oops!

</Aside>

## Part two

In the second video, we tackled the more difficult problem of finding a Knight’s
Tour around a chessboard. It still turned out to be pretty easy, though:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

I only mention it in passing, but you can
[compile](https://sentient-lang.org/cli/compile) and
[optimise](https://sentient-lang.org/cli/optimise) programs which makes them
run _much_ faster.

You can also set the [machine](https://sentient-lang.org/solvers/overview) which
can result in another order of magnitude speed up!

</Aside>

## In conclusion

A few years <span ref={r = createRef()}>ago</span>, [I tried to
produce](https://makercasts.org/) screencasts of my own but ended up hating
everything I recorded. Perhaps this experience will spur me on to try again.

<Aside target={r}><p>
At some point I’ll shut down that site and move its content to this one.

By the sounds of it, Dmitry had a similar experience. Sitting alone in a
darkened room trying to narrate while you code is challenging. Not so much the
technical side of it, but its vacuous nature. You have no feedback to guide what
you’re doing.

That’s why I think this format works so well. Pair programming is more informal.
It’s like the day job. There’s <span ref={r = createRef()}>expectation</span>
you’ll make mistakes and break off in the middle of sentences. When you do,
there’s someone there to pick up the thread.

<Aside target={r}><p>
Both videos were recorded in a single take, near Angel in London.
</p></Aside>

I genuinely hope you enjoy(ed) the videos. They firmly fit in the category of
_"try to share more of what you’re doing, tuzz"_. If you have any questions or
comments, add <span ref={r = createRef()}>them</span> on YouTube or [tweet at
me](https://twitter.com/chrispatuzzo) - and/or follow me for more computer-y
goodness.

<Aside target={r}><p>
Ahh, the YouTube comments section, aka. a dumpster fire.
