Running my Rust-powered search algorithm
</Figure.Video>

A superpermutation is a string of numbers that contains every permutation of
those numbers. For example, ‘123121321’ contains all <span ref={r =
createRef()}>six</span> permutations of three numbers:

<Aside target={r}>
123, 231, 312, 213, 132 and 321.
</Aside>

One way to construct a superpermutation is to concatenate all N! permutations
together but this is wasteful. We’d end up with a <span ref={r =
createRef()}>string</span> of length 18 instead of 9:

<Aside target={r}>
‘123231312213132321’
</Aside>

The _trick_ is to try and overlap permutations as much as possible. <span
ref={r = createRef()}>Most</span> of the time, when we add a character this
also add a permutation, but not always. A ‘greedy’ algorithm works fairly well
to find _short_ strings, but they might not be optimal.

<Aside target={r}>
A ‘greedy’ approach is short sighted in that it picks characters that seem like
good choices now but end up costing more in the long run.
</Aside>

So the question is: **how short can these strings be?**

Many people are trying to figure that out, either constructively, by
exhaustive search for the shortest string, or non-constructively, by proof of
its exact <span ref={r = createRef()}>length</span>. Ideally, we’d come up with
an efficient process to build the shortest possible string.

<Aside target={r}>

It might be this problem is [NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness) and no efficient process exists.

</Aside>

I’m certainly no mathematician so I won’t tackle a proof, but I do know some
things about writing efficient search algorithms. In this article I’ll explain
my recent attempt to find **minimal <span ref={r =
createRef()}>superpermutations</span>** - in this case, those that happen to be
palindromes.

<Aside target={r}>
A palindrome is a string that’s the same forwards and backwards.
</Aside>

Along the way I wrote some C and Rust code. I’ll focus on the high-level
approach in this article and save a detailed walk-through of the code for the
next.

<H3 id="why-palindromes">Why palindromes?</H3>

In general, minimal superpermutations need not be palindromes. It so <span
ref={r = createRef()}>happens</span> for N=1 to 4 they _are_, but no one has
proved whether or not this is always true. In fact, for N=5 there are
[_eight_ shortest strings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superpermutators/superperm/master/superpermutations/5/153-chaffin.txt)
tied at 153 characters - one of which is a palindrome.

<Aside target={r}>

For N=6, no one knows! The best strings so far have 872 characters, none of
which are palindromes.

</Aside>

I decided to limit my search to palindromes because I think there’s fair chance
the <span ref={r = createRef()}>shortest</span> superpermutation _is_ a
palindrome and this lets us reduce the search space, making the problem more
tractable. **Otherwise, the search might never finish.**

<Aside target={r}>

For the last few a months a [large distributed search](http://www.supermutations.net/ChaffinMethodResults/)
has been trying to solve the general case for N=6.

</Aside>

Actually, I wholly expect the search not to finish anyway - even with this
limitation. I’m going to run it for a month or two on the N=6 problem to see
how far it gets, but I have low expectations. The [combinatorial
abyss](https://twitter.com/chrispatuzzo/status/1067403432674435072) is vast and
unforgiving.

<H3 id="no-repetition">No repetition</H3>

There’s one more assumption I’m going to make about minimal superpermutations.
That is: they do not contain the same permutation more than once. In other
words, each and every permutation appears exactly once in the string, with no
repetition.

Again, there’s no proof of this, but there’s mounting evidence this is the case.
For the N=6 problem, [more than ten
thousand](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m8mHizDHoDpT-9ohCiqmfKyQI6gmhuyuzb7TC7362Ko/edit#gid=0)
strings have been found with the shortest known length of 872. As far as I’m
aware none of these repeat a permutation.

With <span ref={r = createRef()}>this</span> assumption in place, we can prune
strings from our search that contain repetition - reducing the search space.
This improves our chances of success.

<Aside target={r}>
It might seem arbitrary to do this. We’ll see shortly how the benefits of this
assumption are compounded when searching for palindromes.
</Aside>

<H2 id="how-it-works">How it works</H2>

At a high level, the algorithm works by searching for the shortest string that
contains exactly half the permutations. This string must also have the special
property that its reversal contains precisely the _other half_ of the
permutations (the ones it’s missing).

When this string is <span ref={r = createRef()}>glued</span> together with its
reversal, it forms a palindrome that is a superpermutation - a string that
contains all N! permutations.

<Aside target={r}>
We overlap the last character of the string with the first of its reversal.
</Aside>

For example, ‘12312’ contains 123, 231 and 312 which are three of the six
permutations for N=3. Its reversal ‘21321’ contains 213, 132 and 321 which are
precisely the _other three_ permutations it’s missing so it has the property we
want.

That means we can glue ‘12312’ and ‘21321’ together to obtain <span ref={r =
createRef()}>‘123121321’</span> which now contains all N! permutations - making
a (palindromic) superpermutation.

<Aside target={r}>
We overlap the ‘2’ in the middle.
</Aside>

<H3 id="dfs">Depth-first search</H3>

The <span ref={r = createRef()}>search</span> is depth first, starting from the
12...N permutation. This can be thought of as the root node of a search tree.
At each step, we ‘expand’ one string by adding a single character to the end of
it. This adds a child node to the search tree.

<Aside target={r}>
The code doesn’t explicitly build a search tree. It manifests itself through
recursive function calls. I just find it useful to think in this way.
</Aside>

From Wikipedia: “A depth-first search explores as far as possible along each
branch before backtracking.” When we translate that definition to this problem,
it means we should expand longer and longer strings before backtracking to
expand shorter ones:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure>

```bash
                1234
                /  \
             12341  (not expanded yet)
             /
          123412
          /
      1234121
       /
     ...
```

A depth-first search starting from the ‘1234’ root node
</Figure>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={30}>

**Why depth-first search?**

The main reason is to find long strings early on in the search to learn about
the problem’s structure.

We’ll see in the ‘Chaffin’ section how to use these learnings to our advantage
to speed up the search.

In other projects, I’ve tried different algorithms
([A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm),
reduction to [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem)) which I
might write about later.

</Aside>

There’s still the question of when to backtrack. This is where our ‘No repeats’
assumption comes into play. When a string is expanded, we check:

1. Is the tail of the string a permutation?
2. If so, have we seen it before?

If the answer is _yes_ we <span ref={r = createRef()}>backtrack</span>. There’s
no point expanding the string further since we’re not interested in
superpermutations that contain repetition.

<Aside target={r}>
Backtracking is really good! It eliminates regions of search space that
can’t possibly bear fruit.
</Aside>

<H3 id="the-magic">The magic</H3>

However, we can go one step further! We know we’re going to glue this string to
its reversal. That means **all permutations seen so far will be seen again** -
but in reverse. Our assumption is each permutation appears once in the
_entirety_ of the string.

That means **we can check the tail of the string a second time**. If we’ve seen
its reversal before we can backtrack as well. This pre-empts the repetition
that _would occur_ when the string is glued later. This lets us eliminate even
more <span ref={r = createRef()}>strings!</span>

<Aside target={r}>
We can see the future.
</Aside>

Here’s what the code might look like:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure>

```rust
if permutations_seen[tail_of_string] {
  return; // backtrack
}

tail_of_string.reverse();

if permutations_seen[tail_of_string] {
  return; // backtrack
}
```

Backtracking if we’ve seen the tail of string in reverse
</Figure>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={85}>

In Rust, the [`.reverse()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.reverse) function mutates in place.

</Aside>

I think of this as the _magic_ of this approach. It’s this combination of ideas
that initially motivated me to try writing the search algorithm. Whether or not
it makes a significant dent in the problem remains to be seen but it’s worth a
shot.

Finally, there’s one last piece we need to supercharge the search algorithm.

<H2 id="the-chaffin-method">The ‘Chaffin’ method</H2>

The search incorporates a clever technique devised by Benjamin Chaffin. The
basic idea is to break the problem into a <span ref={r =
createRef()}>sequence</span> of subproblems. We can then use the solution to
the first subproblem to speed up solving the second, and so on.

<Aside target={r}>

This is an example of [incremental heuristic search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_heuristic_search).

</Aside>

Each subproblem is stated in terms of ‘wasted’ characters. A wasted character
is one that doesn’t add a new permutation itself but instead, prepares the
string so the next character can add a permutation. Sometimes more than one in a
row is needed.

For <span ref={r = createRef()}>example</span>, when ‘1’ is appended to ‘12312’
we get ‘123121’. The ‘1’ character is deemed _wasted_ because it doesn’t add a
new permutation to the string. It does however prepare the string for a
subsequent ‘3’ which adds the 213 permutation.

<Aside target={r}>
The term ‘wasted’ is a bit harsh since the character is useful, it just doesn’t
add a new permutation.
</Aside>

Now that we understand wasted characters, subproblems are defined as:

> How many permutations can fit into a string that has W wasted characters?

The <span ref={r = createRef()}>algorithm</span> starts by solving the W=0 case
by depth-first search. It enumerates all strings that do not waste any
characters and counts how many permutations appear in them. The maximal count
of permutations is the solution of the subproblem.

<Aside target={r}>
For W=0, the solution is always equal to N since that’s the longest string before
we hit a cycle: ‘12312’
</Aside>

<H3 id="climbing-a-ladder">Climbing a ladder</H3>

The algorithm proceeds to solve the W=1 subproblem, using the solution of W=0 to
speed up the search. <span ref={r = createRef()}>This</span> works by pruning
strings that can’t possibly produce a maximal count of permutations because
they’ve already wasted too many characters.

<Aside target={r}>

This is an example of [branch and
bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound).

</Aside>

For <span ref={r = createRef()}>example</span>, when solving W=1, if we’ve seen
‘12312132’ which contains five permutations, there’s no point expanding ‘1232’
because we know from W=0 this string is doomed to failure. It can’t possible
beat the string with five permutations.

<Aside target={r}>
‘1232’ contains one permutation and wastes one character. In the best case, W=0
tells us we can add three permutations, totalling four.
</Aside>

We then proceed to solve W=2, W=3 and so on. At each step we refer back to all
previous solutions to prune the search. The code looks something like this:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure>

```rust
let surplus_waste = W - current_waste;

let max_perms = subproblem_solutions[surplus_waste];
let best_perms = current_perms + max_perms;

if best_perms <= *best_seen_so_far {
  return; // prune this string
}
```

Pruning strings by using solutions to previous subproblems
</Figure>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={96}>

`*best_seen_so_far` points to a value shared across all branches of the
search. If we [passed by
value](https://www.mathwarehouse.com/programming/passing-by-value-vs-by-reference-visual-explanation.php),
neighbors wouldn’t see changes and we’d miss opportunities to prune.

</Aside>

A <span ref={r = createRef()}>(contrived)</span> analogy is to imagine
climbing a ladder. The search algorithm is working on one of the rungs and is
supported by preceding rungs to get its job done.

<Aside target={r}>

contrived != helpful

</Aside>

The addition of Chaffin’s method has a dramatic impact on the effectiveness of
the <span ref={r = createRef()}>search</span>. For N=5, the search completes
almost instantly. Without this code, it grinds to a halt. It would likely take
a _very_ long time to finish the search.

<Aside target={r}>

I first read about Chaffin’s method in
[this article](http://www.njohnston.ca/2014/08/all-minimal-superpermutations-on-five-symbols-have-been-found/) by Nathaniel Johnston.
