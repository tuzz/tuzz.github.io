<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<div className="note">
This is the second of two parts on Bash completion. Part one
is <a href="/blog/how-bash-completion-works">here</a>.
</div>

<Figure.Video src="/videos/zz-completion.mp4" className="more_space">
A reminder of what we’re trying to achieve
</Figure.Video>

In part one we looked at the basic mechanics of Bash completion. In this part
we’ll walk through its implementation for my automation tool.

<Aside target={r}>

A quick refresher on part one:

- The `complete` command lets us get/set completion functions
- These functions communicate via environment variables
- Completion kicks in when we hit `<TAB>` on the command-line

</Aside>

Recap: My tool is called `zz` and I use it every day for routine tasks like
provisioning my machine and generating project templates. The animation above
shows some example use cases of Bash completion, e.g. completing `zz pr` to `zz
provision`.

<H2 id="zz-completion-function">
The ‘zz’ completion function
</H2>

I <span ref={r = createRef()}>added</span> Bash completion support in [this
commit](https://github.com/tuzz/zz/commit/c7c90d292a19d2c880c9bac6b50e3d1f0ccfc414).

<Aside target={r}><p>
This article is more Ruby-specific and walks through my commits.
</p></Aside>

First, I register a completion function that passes the entire command line
through to another `zz` command. Then `$COMPREPLY` is set to the result of that
command:

<Figure>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

function _zz () {
  COMPREPLY=($(zz complete $COMP_LINE));
};

complete -F _zz zz
```

Setting a Bash function to complete `zz`
</Figure>

My philosophy with these things is to ‘get the hell out of `<OBSCURE THING>`’
as soon as possible and handle the result in a more <span ref={r =
createRef()}>conventional</span> way. In this case, I want to use my trusty
friend _Ruby_ to determine the list of completions. This may as well be _just
another_ `zz` command since I’ll need access to the tool’s context.

<Aside target={r}>

e.g. I do the same with [Rakefiles](https://ruby.github.io/rake/doc/rakefile_rdoc.html)

</Aside>

The <span ref={r = createRef()}>file</span> is written to
`/usr/local/bin/zz-completion.bash` and I source it in my `~/.profile`. I’m
actually using `zz provision` to ensure this file exists and that it’s sourced.
Now on to the tool-specific behaviour&hellip;

<Aside target={r}><p>
I’m particularly fond of this kind of ‘bootstrapping’ since it pushes the tool
in to the realms of self-reference.
</p></Aside>

<H2 id="completing-command-option-names">
Completing command names
</H2>

My <span ref={r = createRef()}>first</span> goal is to implement completion for
commands and options. The idea being, if I type `zz prov` that should complete
to `zz provision` and if I type `zz <TAB><TAB>`, it should provide a friendly
reminder of all available commands.

<Aside target={r}><p>
How it should work is somewhat arbitrary, but this behaviour seems most
intuitive to me.
</p></Aside>

The same goes for options. If I type `zz provision --li<TAB>`, I’d like that to
complete to `zz provision --list` and `zz provision --<TAB><TAB>` would
remind me of options for the `provision` command.

This <span ref={r = createRef()}>behaviour</span> is implemented in
[this commit](https://github.com/tuzz/zz/commit/046b31d5715661329da8f25eef37de2596a2e59e).

<Aside target={r}><p>
It’s probably easier to look at the tests rather than the implementation.
</p></Aside>

It gets complicated and I could have simplified further. I’m happy it’s
tested and can be refactored later if needs be. I decided to split the code up
by the ‘type’ of completion, i.e. whether it’s the name of a command, an
option, or its <span ref={r = createRef()}>arguments</span>.

<Aside target={r}><p>
More on this later.
</p></Aside>

For each type of completion, I defined a method that takes `args` which is the
full command-line typed by the user as an array of words. The method returns
strings which are fed back as the completion options:

```ruby
def complete_command(args)
  commands = filter_commands(args)
  # ...
  commands.map(&:name)
end
```

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

I made it so these methods can return `false` if this type of completion isn’t
relevant. For example, if the user has already typed `provision` (a command), it
doesn’t make sense to complete the name of a command since we already have that:

<Aside target={r}>

That means we can or (`||`) all our completion methods together to find the
first one that’s ‘relevant’.

This behaviour is implemented
[here](https://github.com/tuzz/zz/commit/046b31d5715661329da8f25eef37de2596a2e59e#diff-c536662908a26a0b8843e81b8ffe42cbR5).

</Aside>

<Figure>

```ruby
def complete_command(args)
  commands = filter_commands(args)

  return false if args.size > 2
  return false if exact_command_match?(commands, args)

  commands.map(&:name)
end
```

Returning `false` if this ‘type’ of completion isn’t relevant
</Figure>

The [`#complete_option`](https://github.com/tuzz/zz/commit/046b31d5715661329da8f25eef37de2596a2e59e#diff-c536662908a26a0b8843e81b8ffe42cbR40-R55)
method is more complicated but uses the same idea.

<H2 id="completion-args-to-options">
Completing option arguments
</H2>

The final piece of the puzzle is to do contextual completion for options.
My original use-case was to complete `zz secret --read amaz` to `zz secret
--read amazon/` which means we need to produce different completions per option.

Conceptually, it would be nice if `--read` were ‘responsible’ for
determining its list of completions. Perhaps it looks at the file system or
[Hashicorp’s Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) to decide.

I haven’t <span ref={r = createRef()}>implemented</span> the `secret` command
yet, but I can still do some ground work for completion now. [This
commit](https://github.com/tuzz/zz/commit/fddbf52238d3e4ab490750f08148b98a6d20b8d1)
implements `#complete_option_arg` which delegates to a Ruby `proc` that can be
set on an `Option`.

<Aside target={r}>

The details here don’t matter. The key is to make `Option` responsible for
producing its completions.

</Aside>

We <span ref={r = createRef()}>can</span> now implement completion for options
by providing them with blocks. For example, here’s how we do that for `template
--type`:

<Figure>

```ruby
def type_option
  help = "sets the type of template (e.g. ruby)"

  @type_option ||= Option.new("t", "type", 1, help) do |args|
    types.select { |t| t.start_with?(args.last) }
  end
end
```

Selecting all types that start with the prefix
</Figure>

<Aside target={r}>

At time of writing, valid template ‘types’ are `ruby`, `rust` and `cpp`.

</Aside>

The block receives all command-line arguments and returns an array of completion
strings. In this case, we find all template types that start with the last
argument on the command-line, so if the user types `template --type ru`, it
selects `ruby` and `rust`.

A more complicated example is the `provision --only` option which accepts a list
of Chef recipes. For example, you might say `provision --only vim,ruby`.

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure>

```ruby
def auto_complete_recipe_list(args)
  *head, prefix = args.last.downcase.split(",")
  list = recipes.select { |r| r.start_with?(prefix || "") }

  return recipes if list == [prefix]

  list.map { |l| (head + [l]).join(",") }
end
```

An option that completes comma-separated lists
</Figure>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={55}>

Implemented in [this commit](https://github.com/tuzz/zz/commit/62dbff256963d8ff0a8e23f54e0b5969fd277ba5).

That mysterious `return` statement is explained below.

</Aside>

<H3 id="gotchas">A few ‘gotchas’</H3>

Bash sometimes tries to be <span ref={r = createRef()}>helpful</span> which can
often lead to surprising behaviour. For example, if all available completions
start with the same prefix, Bash replaces the word at the end of the
command-line with that prefix.

<Aside target={r}>

e.g. if we returned `ruby` and `rust` as our completions, Bash would replace the
last word with ‘`ru`’ since that’s the common prefix.

</Aside>

That’s why we have to copy the list into each completion:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

```bash
$ zz provision --only vim,ru<TAB><TAB>
vim,ruby  vim,rust
```

<Aside target={r}>

Otherwise, we’d lose `vim` from our list if it was replaced with just ‘`ru`’.

</Aside>

However, this can be noisy if we have lots of completion options:

<Figure>

```bash
$ zz provision --only vim,ruby<TAB><TAB>
vim,ruby,aws   vim,ruby,chrome   vim,ruby,dock   # ...many more
```

Noisy output: the comma-separated list is duplicated
</Figure>

Ideally, we want it to just return the names of available recipes without all
the noise but we can’t do that because Bash will replace our list by the common
prefix. In this situation, Bash’s helpfulness has backfired and results in more
noise than we’d like.

<H3 id="fighting-back">Fighting back</H3>

Knowledge is <span ref={r = createRef()}>power</span> and it so happens there’s
this _one weird trick_ we can use to get around the problem. Since we know Bash
will only do the ‘wrong’ thing if there’s a common prefix, we can check for
that and return a clutter-free list when there isn’t:

<Aside target={r} moveDown={10}>

Arguably, this approach could be brittle if small changes are made to how Bash
completion works, but I don’t see that happening soon.

It might also vary by operating system or version, I’m not sure.

</Aside>

<Figure>

```bash
$ zz provision --only vim,ruby<TAB><TAB>
aws   chrome   dock   drive   dropbox   ffmpeg   # ...
```

Less noisy output: without the duplication
</Figure>

That’s what this lines is for:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

```ruby
return recipes if list == [prefix]
```

<Aside target={r}>

It’s might be useful to refer back to `#auto_complete_recipe_list`, but I had to
stare at this for several minutes to remember how it works.

</Aside>

My implementation’s a bit simpler in that it just checks for an exact match
between the prefix and the filtered list of recipes. This has the desired
effect because completing `vim,ruby` or `vim,` now displays the full list of
recipes.

This could be smarter and check for a ‘common prefix’ more directly, but it’s
already complicated. Here are some unit test for this behaviour:

<span ref={r = createRef()} />

<Figure>

```ruby
expect(complete.call([""])).to include("git", "ruby", "vim")
expect(complete.call(["ru"])).to eq ["ruby", "rust"]
expect(complete.call(["VI"])).to eq ["vim", "virtualbox"]

expect(complete.call(["x"])).to eq []
expect(complete.call(["ruby"])).to include("git", "ruby", "vim")

# Although this exact-matches, there are other options:
expect(complete.call(["Chrome"])).to eq ["chrome", "chromedriver"]

# ...
```

Unit tests for `provision --only` option completion
</Figure>

<Aside target={r} moveDown={45}>

I also automatically downcase the user-input in case I’m feeling overly
pedantic and want to use proper nouns, e.g. `Vim,Ruby`

</Aside>

It’s been fun to understand the mechanics of feature we often don’t think about.
Bash completion adds a friendly touch that can make our command-line tools
easier to use through back-and-forth interactions with the user.

I think we should <span ref={r = createRef()}>consider</span> completion
features in the context of user experience, accessibility and interface design.
We should strive to build completion behaviours that help users navigate our
tools and discover features.

<Aside target={r}><p>
I’m not saying it’ll make things drastically better, but it all adds up.
</p></Aside>

For those implementing this behaviour, it’s helpful to know we can ‘escape’ out
to our favourite programming languages without too much difficulty. This blog
post has been about Bash because that’s what I use, but the concepts should be
applicable wherever it’s implemented - though the mechanics will be different.

Finally, <span ref={r = createRef()}>I’d</span> be interested to hear if you
come up with some novel way to use completion. [Tweet at
me](https://twitter.com/chrispatuzzo) if you write your own choose-your-own
adventure game with it, or some wacky chess program.

<Aside target={r}><p>
Or have your completion function tweet at me with the contents of your current
command-line.
